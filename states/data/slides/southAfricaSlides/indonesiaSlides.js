        The slaves from Indonesia tended to work in semi-skilled and domestic

        An Indonesian slave, Leander van Boegies (he was a member of the
        Buginese tribe in Sulawesi), was the founder around 1730 of a colony of
        runaway slaves at the southeastern tip of False Bay, where Pringle Bay
        is today. The colony existed for about a century and researchers believe
        many of the inhabitants of neighbouring Kleinmond, Hawston and
        Fisherhaven are among their descendants.
