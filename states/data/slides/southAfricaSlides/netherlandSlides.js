        While the Portuguese were the first Europeans to set foot in southern
        Africa, naming the area of Cape Town as The Cape of Good Hope, it was
        the Dutch who established the Cape Colony in 1652. Initially, this was
        only to serve as a trading post en route to Asia, supplying the Dutch
        East India Company (VOC) ships with fresh food and water, and a place to
        stop for rest.

        But this land was already occupied by the Khoisan (or Khoikhoi) people,
        whose way of life revolved around hunter-gathering and cattle herding.
        The Dutch traded with the Khoekhoe for a while, exchanging tobacco and
        brandy for fresh meat.

        Due to conflict and colonization, European diseases decimated Khoekhoe
        populations and they were increasingly pushed out of their lands. The
        conflict was eventually resolved with a peace treaty in which the
        Khoekhoe had to offer 30 cattle to the VOC annually and vow never to
        attack Dutch settlements again.

        Many employees of the VOC retired in the Cape Colony, where they were
        given land to farm on condition, they sell their crops to the VOC at a
        fixed price. The farms were very labor intensive, so the Vryberghers
        (free citizens) imported slaves from Angola, Madagascar, Mauritius,
        Mozambique and Asia (Dutch East Indies and Dutch Ceylon) to work the
        land.

        As a half-way point between Asia and Europe, the Cape Colony also
        resupplied many VOC slave voyages passing through, including those which
        would go on to transport Africans to slave markets in the Americas. The
        Dutch shipped between 550,000–600,000 Africans in the Atlantic Slave
        Trade alone.
