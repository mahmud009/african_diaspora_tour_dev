        Slavery in Southern Africa existed until the abolition of slavery in the
        Cape Colony on 1 January 1834. This followed the British banning the
        trade of slaves between colonies in 1807 with their emancipation by
        1834.

        The Khoisan were the first inhabitants of southern Africa and one of the
        earliest distinct groups of Homo sapiens, enduring centuries of gradual
        dispossession at the hands of every new wave of settlers, including the
        Bantu, whose descendants make up most of South Africa's black population
        today.

        Increased European encroachment ultimately led to the colonisation and
        occupation of South Africa by the Dutch. The Cape Colony remained under
        Dutch rule until 1795 before it fell to the British Crown, before
        reverting back to Dutch Rule in 1803 and again to British occupation in
        1806.

        With colonialism, which began in South Africa in 1652, came the Slavery
        and Forced Labour Model. This was the original model of colonialism
        brought by the Dutch in 1652, and subsequently exported from the Western
        Cape to the Afrikaner Republics of the Orange Free State and the
        Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek.

        South Africa became a fully sovereign nation state within the British
        Empire, in 1934 following enactment of the Status of the Union Act.
        <br />
        <br />
        The monarchy came to an end on 31 May 1961, replaced by a republic as
        the consequence of a 1960 referendum, which legitimised the country
        becoming the Republic of South Africa.

        After 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first black
        head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic
        election, was freed in 1990 and negotiated with State President F. W. de
        Klerk the end of apartheid in South Africa, bringing peace to a racially
        divided country and leading the fight for human rights around the world.
