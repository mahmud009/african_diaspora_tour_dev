        A large number of individuals from India were sold/forced into slavery
        in South Africa by the Dutch. That said, the modern South African Indian
        community is largely descended from Indians who arrived in South Africa
        from 1860 onwards aboard the Truro from Madras, followed by the
        Belvedere from Calcutta.

        Indians were imported as it was found by colonial authorities that local
        black Africans were economically self-sufficient, and thus unwilling to
        subject themselves to employment by colonial farmers, while other
        colonial authorities believed that the "hunting and warrior" African
        culture of the time was incompatible with a sudden shift to employed
        labor.

        themselves as an important general labor force in Natal particularly as
        industrial and railway workers, with others engaging in market
        gardening, growing most of the vegetables consumed by the white
