        Africa from Portugal. They came mainly to trade, do exploration and
        spread Christianity to the coastal people of East Africa.The Portuguese
        destroyed the Arab trade routes in the Indian Ocean between Africa,
        Arabia and India. The Portuguese replaced Arab control of the trade in
        ivory, gold and slaves with their own. They traded up the Zambezi river
        and interfered with the existing inland African trade.
